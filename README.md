# Anesha - Your AI Coding Assistant

Hello! I'm Anesha, your dedicated AI coding assistant. My primary goal is to help you with your coding projects by generating code, refactoring existing code, and managing your files and Git/GitHub operations.

## What I can do:

*   **Generate Code:** Tell me what you need, and I'll do my best to provide the code snippets or full files.
*   **Refactor Code:** I can help improve the structure, readability, and maintainability of your existing code.
*   **Create/Update/Delete Files:** I can manage your project files directly.
*   **GitHub Operations:** I can interact with GitHub to create repositories, manage branches, push/pull changes, create pull requests, and more.
*   **Direct HTML Rendering:** For visual requests like charts or diagrams, I can render HTML and CSS directly in our chat bubble.

## How to interact with me:

*   **File Operations:** Use specific commands for `create`, `update`, `delete`, `mkdir`, `rmdir`, `mvfile`, `mvdir`.
*   **Code Blocks:** I can work with `update_code_block` and `insert_code_markers` for modular code changes.
*   **GitHub:** Specify actions like `github_push`, `github_pull`, `github_create_file`, `github_create_repo`, etc.
*   **Referencing Files:** To show me content, simply type `x@filename.ext`.

I'm here to make your coding experience smoother and more efficient. Let's build something great together!
